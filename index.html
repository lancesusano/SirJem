<h1> Hello! </h1>
<p align="justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Lance Budomo and I live in the farthest part of Muntinlupa City; perhaps, a few more minutes before tapping the territorial boundaries of Laguna. My family and I used to live in my paternal grandmother’s house whose facades befit a bourgeoise ilk until the summer of 2006 when my maternal grandparents flew themselves to New York with the intention of visiting our distant relatives. As expected, one thing led to another and the news of their migration followed. Seeing the nonviability of leaving their memory-laced home into abandonment, my mother, along with us, decided to move in. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moving in was never easy, considering that I’m now far from my cousins who used to share the same space as I. Thinking about it now, we never really did share much in common. I mean, sure, we shared days beneath the early morning sun together, but I hold the rights in claiming that I bathed far longer. Most of their childhood experiences were laced in movies, video games, and other indoor activities; whereas, I spent most of my days playing piko, bang-sak, and tagu-taguan with our neighbors. In this occurrence I’ve validated one thing in specific: our lifestyles greatly differ. Truly, I never took interest in their preferences and it sometimes led me to believe that this might be the logical explanation to why I experience isolation – oftentimes denigration. I wouldn’t say it didn’t matter; company and sympathy was all I ever wanted when I was younger. Gladly, I have my brother who spent most of his time with me despite the existing ties he had with my cousins. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of my earlier days were allocated to music and painting. It all started as a hobby to pass the time, but in their cathartic properties, I've developed a passion in each of them. They served as a better alternative in purging felt emotional conflicts; as oppose to the unruly set of behaviors I was once fond of. I brought these artistic tendencies in high school and have established a circle of friends with the similar interest. In our attempt to delve deeper as far as the field of academics is concerned, my friends and I tried out for our school’s debate team. Along with progressive prayers and hoping, I was part of those who were accepted. The following year since the recruitment, the school sent us to University of the Philippines to compete in an event called SLIDE or Southern Luzon Interschool Debate. Unfortunately, fate decided that the tournament wasn’t ours for the taking after a close match against UP Los Baños. We ended the tournament with the standing of three consecutive wins against La Salle and two losses from UPLB and ADMU. Either way, I am proud of what we have accomplished. In my robust love for the arts, I’ve also participated in various stage plays and was oftentimes asked to play a song or two in an event hosted by the school. These extracurricular activities, however, took a toll on my academic performance. To make matters clear, I wasn't a failing student, it’s just that I was an average student who knew he could’ve been more.  
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently an eighteen-year-old boy who enjoys the same activities I’ve enjoyed since I was younger – with an addition of literature and filmmaking. I take interest in both the science and the arts with great hopes of establishing a contribution to which humanity could benefit from. This aspiration, I believe, is laced with my biggest fear above all: to be forgotten; for a biological circle to turn relentlessly through time where its inhabitants possess no known details about my individuality or name. I want to be remembered; and I’ve come to terms with the fact that such occurrence can only be attained by leaving something remarkable before our clock hits the final tick. In a wide discourse within the contemporary Filipino society regarding the existence of forever, I answer this with the statement: Flesh will rot and all bones will crumble, but a remarkable idea will stand strong forever.
